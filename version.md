# Bible App — Version History

## v3.0.0

### New Features
- **Settings page** — Users can enter their own API keys (stored locally, never shared)
- **Desktop app** — Electron packaging for Mac (.dmg), Windows (.exe), and Linux (.AppImage)
- **Custom app icon** — Logo displayed in Dock, taskbar, and window title

### Bug Fixes
- **Fixed Electron CommonJS error** — Renamed `main.js` to `main.cjs` to avoid ES module conflict

### Infrastructure
- Switched from BrowserRouter to HashRouter for Electron compatibility
- Added `base: './'` to Vite config for file:// protocol support

## v2.0.0

### New Features
- **CSB & NLT translations** — Added Christian Standard Bible and New Living Translation support
- **Reading location persistence** — Clicking the Read tab returns you to where you left off

### Bug Fixes
- **Fixed API.Bible URL** — Changed from `scripture.api.bible` to `rest.api.bible`
- **Fixed Bible IDs** — Corrected NASB1995, CSB, and NLT Bible IDs on API.Bible
- **Fixed USFM book mapping** — API.Bible requires USFM book codes (e.g., `PSA`, `1JN`); was sending incorrect abbreviations causing 400 errors
- **Fixed verse text cut off across paragraphs** — Verses spanning multiple `<p>` tags in API.Bible HTML (e.g., Matthew 1:6 NASB1995) are now fully captured
- **Fixed poetry formatting** — Psalm poetry now renders with proper line breaks and indented continuation lines
- **Fixed verse number placement** — Verse numbers appear inline with the first line of text in poetry, not on a separate line
- **Fixed ESV section headings** — Headings and subtitles (e.g., Psalm superscriptions) are extracted and rendered
- **Fixed ESV prose paragraph breaks** — Paragraph spacing now appears between verse groups in prose passages
- **Fixed stanza breaks** — Poetry stanza breaks now show proper vertical spacing
- **Fixed API.Bible section headings** — `<p class="s">` heading tags are now correctly parsed
